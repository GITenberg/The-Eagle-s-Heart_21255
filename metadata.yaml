description: Here is the story of Black Mose, who exemplifies the courageous, self-reliant
  cowboy who heads to the mountains to escape a confining and guilt-ridden past for
  freedom in the untamed west. Garland based this engrossing Western on the lives
  of his playmates in Iowa, many of whom hoped to run away to become scouts or cowboys.
